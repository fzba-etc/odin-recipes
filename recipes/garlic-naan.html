        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <p>Naan</p>
        <ul>
            <li>60 ml Water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Sugar</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoon Instant Yeast</li>
            <li>185 ml Milk Warm</li>
            <li>185 g Plain Yoghurt</li>
            <li>60 ml Oil Olive Oil or Vegetable</li>
            <li>2 cloves Garlic Crushed</li>
            <li>485 g Plain Flour</li>
            <li>1 ¾ teaspoon Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Garlic Butter</p>
        <ul>
            <li>70 g Butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Garlic Paste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoon Coriander or Parsley chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Instant Yeast, Water and Sugar in a large bowl and whisk together, then let that sit for a few minutes. </li>
            <li>Add Milk, Yoghurt, Oil, Garlic, Flour and Salt to the bowl and mic together with your hands until they come together.</li>
            <li>Knead until the Dough comes together and forms a smooth-ish ball. I do this for 7 - 10 minutes in a stand mixer or 12 - 15 minutes by hand.</li>
            <li>Transfer the Dough to a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or greased cling film or plastic wrap and leave to rise for 1 - 1 ½ hours or unto the dough has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Divide Dough into 10 equal pieces and generously flour your work surface AND the rolling pin. Roll each ball into an oval shape about 6-inches long and ⅛ inch thick.</li>
            <li>Warm a Pan (You can use any pan but I prefer cast iron).  Make sure it gets really hot. Test it by adding a few drops of Water. They should sizzle and evaporate quickly.
                Place the Naan onto the hot Pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side. You will notice Bubbles forming all over the Dough.</li>
            <li>Wrap cooked Naan in a dish cloth/kitchen towel and keep them wrapped up.</li>
            <li>Brush the Naan with plenty of melted Garlic Butter (made up of Butter, Garlic, Salt and chopped Parsley or Coriander).</li>
        </ol>
